# BMI-Calculator-Flutter-Dart
<h2> My BMI Calculator using Flutter and Dart! </h2>


<h4> When you enter the app, there is a pop up that tells you to select the corresponding parameters to calculate the BMI. (I decided to create the pop up from scratch in order to practice what I have learned about Layouts, Navigation...)</h4>

<h4> After that you have two buttons for choosing the gender, once you choose one it will be "highlighted" and the other will become part of the background.</h4>

<h4>With an slider you will be able to select your height.</h4>

<h4>Then you have custom made buttons to select your weight and age.</h4>
